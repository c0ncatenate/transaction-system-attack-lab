# Contributing

This lab is intended as a learning and experimentation space for security engineering and
penetration testing. Contributions are welcome, especially in the form of:

- additional attack paths and scenarios,
- improvements to the documentation and diagrams,
- implementations of the placeholder services and exploit scripts,
- examples of detection rules or hardening strategies.

Please avoid contributing anything that is:

- tied to proprietary or confidential systems,
- likely to be misused outside of controlled lab environments.

All contributions should be clearly labelled as educational, and respect the principle of
**only testing systems with explicit permission**.
